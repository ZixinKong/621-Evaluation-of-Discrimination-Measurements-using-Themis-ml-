# 621-Evaluation-of-Discrimination-Measurements-using-Themis-ml-
Extended and used “themis-ml”, an existing open-source fairness-aware machine learning Python library

In detail, we implement three discrimination measures – impact ratio, elift ratio and odds ratio, and we also use them as tools to measure and mitigate discriminatory patterns in machine learning algorithms. 


- Approach
There are two parts in our project:
1) We implement three measurements of discrimination: impact ratio, elift ratio and odds ratio – mathematical formalization
2) We measure the discriminatory score in machine learning algorithms using them – the practical way to apply
